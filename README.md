## Exercise
1. MOVE ALL FUNCTIONS and array from `index.js` into separate files in folders `utils` and `data` - split it by comments above functions
    * function for converting color in hex format -> move into `utils/colors.js` 
    * move math functions into `utils/math.js`
    * same for another types of functions
2. You should have only one implementation of every function. If you need specific function in different file, use export/import
3. You should have same result as `test.js`
    * `npm test` should have same ouput as `npm start`
